# -Dance-Dance-Arrayvolution
In this project we were asked to create a CSE 121 version of Dance Dance Revolution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution).
The game's input and output will be limited to the console but will still capture the essence of DDR.
There is also a creative portion where we were asked to add at least one other array without hard coding it. For my extension I decided to make the game playable for multiple rounds, 
and the score for each round is calculated and stored into an array which is then used in the end screen to display the score for each round, and the users highest score.
